//! Browser entry point: fetch all assets into the engine's VFS, then run
//! the exact same game `main.rs` runs natively.
//!
//! Saves persist to browser localStorage: on wasm the `GameConfig`
//! save-path strings below are localStorage keys, and the values are
//! byte-identical to the native JSON save files (achievements, high
//! scores, input bindings). The key naming and the `insiculous-save`
//! event the site listens for are the engine's `docs/WEB_SAVES.md`
//! contract — the site slug for this game is `invaders`.
//!
//! With `--features editor` the same library builds a SECOND bundle, served at
//! `/playground/invaders/`, that runs this game inside the engine's scene editor.
//! That bundle writes none of the `beinsiculous.games.invaders.*` keys above — an
//! editor session must not record achievements, scores or bindings the site's
//! boards read — and keeps its camera and panel layout in a slot of its own.
