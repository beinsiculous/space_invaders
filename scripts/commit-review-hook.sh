# diffs under THRESHOLD changed lines, and the two doors past the gate below.
# Otherwise DENIES the commit with instructions — informing alone can't stop
# the triggering command.
#
# The two doors, and they mean different things:
#   ADV_REVIEWED=1 prefix   the review HAPPENED — code mode ran and every
#                           finding was adjudicated with the user.
#   a signed skip trailer   the review did NOT happen and a developer said so
#                           in writing, in the commit message (see below).
# ADV_REVIEWED=1 used to cover both, which let an agent skip a review on its
# own reading of a conversation and leave no trace that it had. It no longer
# does: skipping now costs a sentence and a name, written into the history it
# skipped review for.
#
# Be clear about what that buys (review-1 F1): friction and a paper trail, not
# proof of authorship. Nothing here can verify that a human typed the trailers
# — an agent that writes them forges a person's name into the record, which is
# worse than the old silent self-skip, not better. The only thing standing in
# that spot is the instruction, in both SKILL.md files and in the denial below,
# that an agent never writes them. The mechanism makes a skip visible and
# attributable; it does not make it honest.

# "-", which is not a file, so a stdin heredoc falls through to the command
# string, where its body already sits.
#
# Only the part of the command BEFORE any -m/--message is searched (review-2
# F2). git takes its message from one place or the other, never both, so a
# -F that appears after -m is inside the message text — and the denial below
# hands out the string "-F .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG", which a commit describing
# this convention will quote. Reading that file would be the worst possible
# miss: it holds the PREVIOUS attempt's message, the one file on disk likely
# to carry skip trailers, so a stale signature could wave a fresh commit
# through. The earlier comment here claimed no such file would exist. It was
