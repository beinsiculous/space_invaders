# Writes the review to --out (default: review-N.md beside the artifact, N
# auto-incremented) and prints the output path on stdout so callers can capture it.
#
# How the reviewer is actually invoked lives in scripts/lib/headless-agent.sh, which this and
# adversarial-review.sh both source — they used to spell it out separately and drifted apart.
# The reviewer runs in the artifact's directory and may READ this whole repo (read-only; what each
# CLI enforces is in lib/headless-agent.sh's header). The prompt still carries the whole artifact.
#
# Subjects. The artifact must live under review/<subject>/ — one directory per review
# conversation, claimed by its author with a plain `mkdir` — and everything this script writes
# (the review, its prompt temp file, a reviewer's gate) lands beside the artifact. Two sessions
# reviewing at once therefore never claim each other's numbers or overwrite each other's files,
# which they did when review/ was flat.
