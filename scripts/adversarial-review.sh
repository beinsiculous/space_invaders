#   adversarial-review.sh plan <task-spec.md> --author=claude|kimi
#   adversarial-review.sh code <changes.diff> --author=claude|kimi
#
# One agent authors, the other reviews (whoever is not --author). Exactly one
# rebuttal round. All outputs land in review/ (gitignored transients):
#
#   plan mode: plan.md -> review-1.md -> rebuttal-1.md [+ plan-v2.md if revised]
#   code mode: draft.diff (copy of input) -> review-1.md -> rebuttal-1.md
#
# This is the FULLY-HEADLESS variant (both roles run non-interactively). For
# the human-in-the-loop variant where your interactive session (Claude Code or
# kimi) authors and only the review step is headless, use the
# `adversarial-review` skill (.claude/skills/adversarial-review/), which calls
# scripts/request-review.sh for the review step — as does this driver.
#
# How each agent is actually invoked lives in scripts/lib/headless-agent.sh, which this and
# request-review.sh both source. They used to spell it out separately and drifted: this file went
# on passing --quiet and --work-dir long after request-review.sh had recorded that kimi-code
# dropped both, so a kimi-authored run died on any machine without a legacy kimi-cli install.

  plan mode: <input-path> is a task spec; the author drafts a plan first.
  code mode: <input-path> is a diff; the diff itself is the draft.
  --author   who authors/rebuts; the other agent reviews.

You wrote the plan below, which then received the adversarial review that
follows it. Address every numbered finding (F1, F2, ...) explicitly — for each

the failure scenario does not hold). Do not skip or merge findings.

If you accept any finding, output the complete revised plan after a line
containing exactly:
$REVISED_MARKER
If you rebut everything, omit that marker and the revised plan.
Respond with text only — do not modify any files.
